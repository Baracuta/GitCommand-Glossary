   <main>
        <dl class="data_table">
            <dt>Git Add</dt>
                <dd>Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. Prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.</dd>

            <dt>Git Branch</dt>
                <dd>General-purpose branch administration tool. Create isolated developments environments within a repository.</dd>

            <dt>Git Checkout</dt>
                <dd>Used to check out old commits and file revisions, as well as navigate existing branches.</dd>

            <dt>Git Clean</dt>
                <dd>Removes untracked files from the working directly. Logical counterpart to git reset, which (generally) only works on tracked files.</dd>

            <dt>Git Clone</dt>
                <dd>Creates a copy of an existing git repository. The most common way for developers to obtain a working copy of a central repository.</dd>

            <dt>Git Commit</dt>
                <dd>Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with git add, this defines the basic workflow for all git users.</dd>
        
            <dt>Git Config</dt>
                <dd>A convenient way to set configuration options for your git installation. You'll probably only need to use this immediately after installing git on a new machine.</dd>
    
            <dt>Git Init</dt>
                <dd>Initializes a new git repository. If you wish to place a project under revision control, this is the first command you need to learn.</dd>
        
            <dt>Git Pull</dt>
                <dd>Downloads a branch from a remote repository,then immediately merges it into the current branch. Git counterpart to svn update.</dd>
        
            <dt>Git Push</dt>
                <dd>Moves a local branch to another repository, which serves as a convenient way to publish contributions. Like svn commit, but sends a series of commits instead.</dd>
